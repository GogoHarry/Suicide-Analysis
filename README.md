### Project Overview

HealthStat Analytics lacks insights into global suicide patterns, considering demographics, economic factors, and generational trends. This project aims to address this by exploring and visualizing a complex suicide dataset using Tableau to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends. These insights will inform evidence-based public health strategies and interventions.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved exploring the suicide data to answer key questions, such as:

- How do suicide rates vary across countries and demographic groups?

- Are there notable trends in suicide rates based on age and gender?
  
- What is the correlation between economic indicators (GDP) and suicide rates?
  
- How has the suicide rate changed over time in different countries?

- Can we identify countries or regions with particularly high or low suicide rates?
